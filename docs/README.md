# Daycycle docs

Daycyle started as a personal experiment with alternative visualizations of the passage of time, inspired by [Today by Scott Thrift](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottthrift/today) on Kickstarter.

Pixelbandito used Daycyle to learn how to use Polymer to build re-usable web components. As of this writing, he still has far to go.
